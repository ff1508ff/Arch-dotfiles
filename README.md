# Arch dotfiles
These are my dotfiles for my Arch installation.

I'm having a lot of fun configuring :)

If you have any questions or have advice for ricing (or similar things(e.g. tools)) make an issue or something similar to get my attention.

# My Todo List:
- [x] Port every thing from my WSL Ubuntu configuration
- [ ] Add a tiling window manager(e.g. Hyprland)
- [ ] Rewrite my neovim configuration (make it more personal, but not sure if I dump lazyvim or just change what I don't like)
